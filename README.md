This is yet another zlib interface for Julia. It's intended to replace the two
prior zlib packages.

  * [GZip.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/GZip.jl)
  * [Zlib.jl](https://github.com/dcjones/Zlib.jl)

Both have shortcomings that this package aims to address, specifically:

  * Zlib.jl is very slow.
  * GZip.jl is not as slow as Zlib.jl, but still slower than it could to be.
  * GZip.jl only supports file I/O.
  * GZip.jl doesn't support reading/writing plain zlib data.

# API

This library exports four stream types:

 Type | Description
------| ---------------
 `ZlibInflateOutputStream` | read and decompress data
 `ZlibDeflateOutputStream` | read and compress data
 `ZlibInflateInputStream`  | write and decompress data
 `ZlibDeflateInputStream`  | write and compress data

These work like regular `IO` objects. Each takes as a parameter either in input
or output source.


## Examples

```julia
# read lines from a compressed file
for line in eachline(open("data.txt.gz") |> ZlibInflateInputStream)
end

# write compressed data to a file
stream = open("data.txt.gz", "w") |> ZlibDeflateOutputStream
for c in rand(UInt8, 10000)
    write(stream, c)
end
close(stream)

# pointlessly compress and decompress some data
readbytes(rand(UInt8, 10000) |> ZlibDeflateInputStream |> ZlibInflateInputStream)
```

## Other functions

There are convenience `Libz.inflate(::Vector{UInt8})` and `Libz.deflate(::Vector{UInt8})`
functions that take a byte array and return another compressed or decompressed
byte array.

Checksum functions are exposed as `Libz.crc32(::Vector{UIint8})` and
`Libz.adler32(::Vector{UIint8})`.

See [BufferedStreams.jl](https://github.com/dcjones/BufferedStreams.jl) for
benchmarks of this library.
